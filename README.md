# NETFLIX-MOVIES-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING


Business Context

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service's number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, you are required to do

Exploratory Data Analysis

Understanding what type content is available in different countries If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

Clustering similar content by matching text-based features

Conclusion

1.Conducted analysis on a Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform.

2.Explored various visualizations to understand the distribution of TV shows and movies, their durations, genres, and countries of origin.

3.Performed statistical tests to analyze differences in average durations between movies and TV shows, distribution of genres, and relationship between release year and number of seasons.

4.Handled missing values in columns such as director, cast, country, and rating, ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

5.Utilized text normalization techniques such as lemmatization and text vectorization using TF-IDF to process and represent textual data.

6.Explored dimensionality reduction using PCA to reduce the number of features while preserving a significant amount of variance in the data.

7.Applied clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to cluster the movies and TV shows based on their features.

8.Evaluated the clustering models using metrics such as silhouette score to understand the quality and structure of the clusters.

8.Identified the number of clusters that provide the highest silhouette score, enabling better understanding of the underlying patterns and similarities in the data.

9.Chose the final model based on the evaluation metrics and business requirements, considering factors such as interpretability and performance. Generated insights into the clusters, identifying distinct groups of movies and TV shows based on their features.

10.Considered the business impact of the model, highlighting the potential benefits of better content categorization and recommendation, improved user experience, and targeted marketing strategies.

11.Concluded the project with recommendations for further analysis and model refinement, considering factors like additional data sources, feature engineering, and alternative modeling techniques.
